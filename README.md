My game designed to help gamers train their aim for First Person Shooter (FPS) games built in Unity. There are four different training modes: Gridshot, Lineshot, Flickshot, and Tracking. The last mode is a Sensitivity Finder mode where it will take your current sensitivity and put you through rounds of training and calculate a recommended sensitivity for you to use. Enjoy!
